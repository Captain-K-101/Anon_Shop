# Delivery Personnel Features

## Overview
The Anon-Shop application now includes a comprehensive delivery personnel system that allows delivery staff to manage their assigned orders and update delivery statuses.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Delivery Personnel Dashboard
- **Route**: `/delivery`
- **Access**: Only users with `DELIVERY` role
- **Features**:
  - View all assigned orders
  - Update delivery status (Confirmed → Processing → Shipped → Out for Delivery → Delivered)
  - View customer details and delivery addresses
  - Filter orders by status
  - Real-time statistics (Total Assigned, Pending Delivery, Out for Delivery, Delivered)

### 2. Admin Delivery Management
- **Location**: Admin Orders page (`/admin/orders`)
- **Features**:
  - Assign/unassign delivery personnel to orders
  - View currently assigned delivery person for each order
  - Dropdown to select from available delivery personnel
  - Real-time assignment updates

### 3. Backend API Endpoints

#### Delivery Personnel Endpoints
- `GET /api/orders/delivery/assigned` - Fetch assigned orders for delivery personnel
- `PUT /api/orders/:id/delivery-status` - Update delivery status (delivery personnel only)

#### Admin Endpoints
- `GET /api/users/delivery-personnel` - Fetch all delivery personnel
- `PUT /api/orders/:id/assign-delivery` - Assign/unassign delivery personnel to orders

### 4. Security & Access Control
